Unlike `require.resolve()`, this module also resolves packages without an entry point, returns `null` instead of throwing when the module can't be found, and resolves from `process.cwd()` instead `__dirname` by default.\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save resolve-pkg\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst resolvePkg = require('resolve-pkg');\n\n// $ npm install --save-dev grunt-svgmin\n\nresolvePkg('grunt-svgmin/tasks', {cwd: __dirname});\n//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn/node_modules/grunt-svgmin/tasks'\n\n// Fails here as Grunt tasks usually don't have a defined main entry point\nrequire.resolve('grunt-svgmin/tasks');\n//=> Error: Cannot find module 'grunt-svgmin'\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### resolvePkg(moduleId, [options])\n\n#### moduleId\n\nType: `string`\n\nWhat you would use in `require()`.\n\n#### options\n\n##### cwd\n\nType: `boolean`<br>\nDefault: `process.cwd()`\n\nDirectory to resolve from.\n\n\n## Related\n\n- [resolve-cwd](https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-cwd) - Resolve the path of a module from the current working directory\n- [resolve-from](https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-from) - Resolve the path of a module from a given path\n- [req-from](https://github.com/sindresorhus/req-from) - Require a module from a given path\n- [req-cwd](https://github.com/sindresorhus/req-cwd) - Require a module from the current working directory\n- [lazy-req](https://github.com/sindresorhus/lazy-req) - Require modules lazily\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sindresorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-14T10:46:03.388Z","created":"2015-12-19T17:23:21.170Z","0.1.0":"2015-12-19T17:23:21.170Z","0.2.0":"2016-08-05T20:27:21.518Z","1.0.0":"2017-01-13T09:37:31.164Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-pkg#readme","keywords":["require","resolve","path","module","from","like","path","cwd","current","working","directory","grunt","main","entry","point"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-pkg.git"},"author":{"name":"Sindre Sorhus","email":"sindresorhus@gmail.com","url":"sindresorhus.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/resolve-pkg/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","users":{"sbruchmann":true,"mrahmadawais":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a5b34eb-1c09\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 14 Jan 2018 10:46:03 GMT"}
